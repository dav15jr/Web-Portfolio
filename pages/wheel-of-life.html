            <p>This is my first independent project built from scratch, from idea to design and implementation. I wanted to create something related to one on my passions. Hence why I decided on a gym tracker. Its purpose is to help keep track of your workouts.</p>   
            <p>You begin by creating your workout personalised plan using different exercises. And then begin your workout and track your progress. Your workouts can be saved in local storage and loaded for your next workout session. </p>
            <img src="/img/WOL Excel.png" alt="" class="zoom_img">
            <p>I began by writing what I wanted the app to accomplish and how it should work. I then moved on to drawing what the app should look like from a UI perspective. This was a brief plan and design with a lot of changes and updates implemented and more still to be possibly added in the future.</p>

            <p>As this was my first independent project I started with the basics (Html, Css and JS). I then later on started implementing React & TypeScript into the project to improve and enhance its functionality.</p>
            <p> Using a lot of what I had learnt in my previous tutorial projects and some new concepts that I had to learn along the way. The current version works well but has space for improvement and additional features. </p>
